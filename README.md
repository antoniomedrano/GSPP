# GSPP
A Processing implementation of the Gateway Shortest Path Problem (GSPP) on raster data. Processing is a Java-based language with additional graphical functions and an IDE for simple code development suitable for graphics and animations. This also uses the *Gleyzer et al.* (2004) recursive algorithm to add Strahler stream ordering hierarchy to the shortest path trees to see if this approach would be a good way to automate the selection of "good" gateway points that result in paths that are spatially diverse from the shortest path yet minimally longer.

**Requirements**  
Requires [Processing](https://processing.org/) (last tested with v3.5.3)
